# Events-Burst-detection-in-social-media
Collectively, events serve as a succinct summary of social media streamy, but the main goal of this project is to reveal the evolution of twitter phenomena over time by the preprocessing of huge volumes of data with high level of noise because	Social media is dynamic, and information is posted with timestamps. 

So, with this everything twitter post changing over the time, each minute numerous of text is shared and retweets abundantly. Such sharing pattern of streaming information contains multiple events around a hashtag and tracking the most common words and find the trending events over time in such stream data is a big challenge

we preprocessed the stream data properly, then found the fads with Kleinbergâ€™s burst detection and Viterbi algorithm, and identify the bursting period according to each unique word which helped us to find the trending and current words.

- Here is our proposed method
